Promises
(Represents the eventual completion(or failure) of an asynchronous operations and it's resulting value)

It is a mechanism for handling asynchronous operations. They provide a way to work with asynchronous code in a more organized and maintainable manner. Promises represent a value that might be available now, or in the future, or not at all.

A Promise has three states:

1. Pending: This is the initial state when the Promise is created and hasn't resolved or rejected yet.
2. Fulfilled (Resolved): This state represents a successful completion of the operation. In this state, the Promise returns a value.
3. Rejected: This state represents an error or failure during the operation. In this state, the Promise returns a reason for the failure.
